## Project Description

YarnShop is a B2B eCommerce platform designed to connect garment companies (consumers) with yarn shops and merchants (sellers). Initially, it is being developed to facilitate connections between multiple verified consumers and a single seller within a specific area, with the potential to onboard new suppliers and expand its services in the future.


## Project Goals 

- Develop a robust and user-friendly online shopping website.
- Implement standard software development methodologies.
- Provide secure authentication and authorization features.
- Utilize Spring Boot, MySQL, Thymeleaf, and Hibernate for backend development.
- Achieve server-side rendering (SSR) for improved SEO and user experience.
